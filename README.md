# AI-Invoice-Processing
ðŸš€ Building a Multi-Agent System for Invoice Processing on AWS

Summary
Managing thousands of invoices manually is costly, slow, and error-prone. By leveraging AWS services, MCP (Model Context Protocol), and a multi-agent approach, we can progressively evolve from a simple invoice pipeline into a scalable, AI-driven system. Hereâ€™s a 3-phase journey:

Phase 1: Baseline Invoice Processing

We begin with a simple but working pipeline: upload invoices, extract data, and store results.

ðŸ”¹ Flow: Web â†’ S3 â†’ Textract â†’ DynamoDB
ðŸ”¹ Tech stack: FastAPI, Boto3, DynamoDB, custom parser
ðŸ”¹ Output: Vendor, totals, and line items in a clean JSON schema

Phase 2: With MCP Server

Now we introduce MCP to centralize and standardize AWS tool access. Instead of every client embedding AWS SDK code, they call MCP tools like s3_put_object and textract_analyze_expense.

ðŸ”¹ Flow: Web â†’ MCP Server â†’ S3 / Textract / DynamoDB
ðŸ”¹ Tech stack: MCP server, AWS tools exposed as APIs
ðŸ”¹ Benefits: Tool reuse, schema safety, centralized IAM, easy integration with LLMs

Phase 3: Multi-Agent System on AWS

Finally, we evolve into a multi-agent workflow where specialized agents collaborate: ingestion, OCR, parsing, validation, enrichment, persistence, and exception handling. Orchestration is done with AWS Step Functions.

ðŸ”¹ Flow: Web â†’ Multi-Agent System â†’ DynamoDB
ðŸ”¹ Tech stack: Step Functions, SQS, Bedrock for enrichment, agents as Lambdas
ðŸ”¹ Capabilities: Parallel processing, validation checks, vendor normalization, audit logs, exception routing

ðŸ‘‰ This journey shows how to start small, add modularity with MCP, and scale into a robust AI-powered invoice processing system.
